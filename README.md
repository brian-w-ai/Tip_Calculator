## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- A lot of freedom was given to us when creating the app so it was a bit hard to know where to start
- Coding in Swift was challenging as it was a new language for me
- Figuring out how to connect different elements on the screen to the code was also challenging
